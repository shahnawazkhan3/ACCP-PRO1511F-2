=============Location Based Services========
Google Play services, which facilitates adding location awareness to your app with automated location tracking,
 geofencing, and activity recognition.

==================The Location Object=================


1)	float distanceTo(Location dest)

	Returns the approximate distance in meters between this location and the given location.

2)	float getAccuracy()

	Get the estimated accuracy of this location, in meters.

3)	double getAltitude()

Get the altitude if available, in meters above sea level.

4)	float getBearing()

Get the bearing, in degrees.

5)	double getLatitude()

Get the latitude, in degrees.

6)	double getLongitude()

Get the longitude, in degrees.

7)	float getSpeed()

Get the speed if it is available, in meters/second over ground.

8)	boolean hasAccuracy()

	True if this location has an accuracy.

9)	boolean hasAltitude()

True if this location has an altitude.

10)	boolean hasBearing()

True if this location has a bearing.

11)	boolean hasSpeed()

True if this location has a speed.

12)	void reset()

Clears the contents of the location.

13)	void setAccuracy(float accuracy)

Set the estimated accuracy of this location, meters.

14)	void setAltitude(double altitude)

Set the altitude, in meters above sea level.

15)	void setBearing(float bearing)

Set the bearing, in degrees.

16)	void setLatitude(double latitude)

Set the latitude, in degrees.

17)	void setLongitude(double longitude)

Set the longitude, in degrees.

18)	void setSpeed(float speed)

Set the speed, in meters/second over ground.

19)	String toString()

Returns a string containing a concise, human-readable description of this object.

====================Get the Current Location============

1	abstract void onConnected(Bundle connectionHint)

This callback method is called when location service is
 connected to the location client successfully. You will use connect() method to connect to the location client.

2	abstract void onDisconnected()

	This callback method is called when the client is disconnected.
 You will use disconnect() method to disconnect from the location client.

3	abstract void onConnectionFailed(ConnectionResult result)

This callback method is called when there was an error connecting 
the client to the service.


=================Get the Updated Location==================

 implement LocationListener

1	abstract void onLocationChanged(Location location)

This callback method is used for receiving notifications from the LocationClient 
when the location has changed.

==================Location Quality of Service================
1	setExpirationDuration(long millis)

	Set the duration of this request, in milliseconds.

2	setExpirationTime(long millis)

	Set the request expiration time, in millisecond since boot.

3	setFastestInterval(long millis)

	Explicitly set the fastest interval for location updates, in milliseconds.

4	setInterval(long millis)

Set the desired interval for active location updates, in milliseconds.

5	setNumUpdates(int numUpdates)

Set the number of location updates.

6	setPriority(int priority)

Set the priority of the request.


==================
location request with setPriority(int) set
 to PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY and setInterval(long)
